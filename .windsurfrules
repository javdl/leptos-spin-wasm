I'm working on my-leptos-app. Here are the key documents to help you understand the current state and context:

This is a Leptos web application that runs on Fermyon Spin using the WASM target. The project is currently in its initial setup phase.

1. Current Status & Priorities:
- Project setup with Nix development environment
- Leptos framework integration with Fermyon Spin
- WASM target configuration

2. Key Technical Components:
- Rust with wasm32-wasip1 target
- Fermyon Spin v3 for serverless WASM
- Leptos framework for frontend
- Nix for development environment management

3. Main Implementation Directories:
- `/src`: Main application source code
- `/style`: Styling assets
- `spin.toml`: Spin configuration
- `Cargo.toml`: Rust dependencies
- `flake.nix`: Nix development environment

4. commands
- `nix develop --command spin build --up` - build and run the application

Based on the current status, suggested next steps:
1. Review and document the application architecture
2. Set up initial routing and components
3. Implement core application features
4. Add styling and UI components
